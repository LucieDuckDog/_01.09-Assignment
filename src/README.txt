**************************** P M R ************************************************
<+s>: Using double typed numbers is very intuitive and similar to using
integer typed numbers.

<-s>: I mixed up the modulus operator with the division operator on accident
while typing.

***********************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to allow user input which would allow users
to see what the output would look like with different operations on the
same number.
