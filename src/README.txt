**************************** P M R ************************************************
<+s>: Concatination in Java is easy, and it is not much different from other similar
languages.

<-s>: I forgot to uncomment the "system.out.println();" statements, which resulted in
a more difficult to read output.

***********************************************************************************
In the future: I could use user input to perform the operations instead of using
hard-coded values.
